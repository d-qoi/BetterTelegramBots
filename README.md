# BetterTelegramBots
The old telegram bots but this time laid out by branches rather than just in folders for reasons.

# Logging Client
A telegram client that is designed to log everything you and everyone else does

## Features
* Tracking everything sent to you from a new user
* Storing the entirety of an old conversation for ease of backing up
* Tracking everything from current PMs, in a similar way to how the admin logs work in a group.
* Tracking everything a user receives from Groups and Super Groups in a similar way to admin logs.

## How to use
* New users are tracked automatically, nothing needed to start tracking
* type a draft of "start tracking" to any group or user, the draft should change to "tracking" when tracking starts
* type a draft of "stop tracking" to stop tracking a group or user
* type a draft of "backup" to record everything from that point onwards in a group
